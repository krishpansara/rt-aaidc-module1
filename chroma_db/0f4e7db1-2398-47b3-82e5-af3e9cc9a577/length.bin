invalid type: string "Today's quantum computers use various technologies including superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and photonic systems. Companies like IBM, Google, and Rigetti have developed quantum processors with dozens to hundreds of qubits. However, current systems are noisy and require error correction for practical applications.\n\nQuantum Computing Applications", expected i64":2911
